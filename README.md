# Flutter Mobile (Android/IOS) Screenshot Receiver

A Flutter Mobile (Android and IOS) application powered by Flutter WebRTC to deliver real time communication between devices. Goal is to receive the stream of images of the desktop app and display them

# Flutter WebRTC Implementation Guide (Desktop & Mobile)

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on setting up and running the Flutter WebRTC implementation using Flutter Desktop and Mobile.

# Purpose of the System

The purpose of this system is for the desktop application to capture screenshots and stream them to the mobile application, where they are displayed in real time.

# Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following:

  * Both the desktop and mobile devices are on the same network.
  * The ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is enabled on the desktop to allow successful pinging between devices.
  * The Socket.IO signaling server is running to facilitate WebRTC communication.

# Setup & Execution

### 1. Enable ICMP Protocol

  Ensure that ICMP is enabled to allow network connectivity verification via ping. This step ensures the mobile device can communicate with the desktop application.
  * On Windows, open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:
  * netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow ICMPv4-In" protocol=icmpv4:any,any dir=in action=allow
  * On Linux/macOS, ICMP is usually enabled by default. If disabled, adjust firewall settings accordingly.

### 2. Start the Socket.IO Signaling Server
   Socket.IO needs to be hosted for real-time communication between the devices:

  #### Host using XAMPP:
  * Download and install XAMPP (if not already installed).
  * Create a directory for the Socket.IO server (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs\socket_server).
  * Place your index.js file in the directory.
  * Start the XAMPP Control Panel and launch Apache and MySQL (if needed).
  * Open a terminal and navigate to the XAMPP directory, then start the server: node C:\xampp\htdocs\socket_server\index.js
  * Ensure the server is accessible through the IP address or domain.
  * You can now use the XAMPP-hosted Socket.IO server for signaling between devices.

### 3. Start the Desktop Application

  * Launch the Flutter Desktop application.
  * Click "Start/Restart Broadcasting" to initiate the WebRTC offer/answer mechanism.
  * The application will generate an offer, and upon receiving an answer from the mobile, it will exchange ICE candidates to establish a connection.

### 4. Begin Screen Capturing

  * Press "Start Screenshot" to start the connection and start the image streaming. Press "End Stream" to stop the streaming

### 5. Connect the Mobile Application

  * Open the Flutter Mobile application.
  * Wait for the desktop application to successfully establish a WebRTC connection with the mobile device.
  * Once connected, the mobile application will start receiving and displaying the streamed images in real time.
  
# Troubleshooting
  
  * If the connection fails, verify that both devices are on the same network and that ICMP is enabled. 
  * Ensure that firewall rules are not blocking WebRTC traffic.
  * Verify that the Socket.IO signaling server is running.
  * Restart the desktop application and retry the process.
